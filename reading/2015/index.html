    <h2>2015 Reading</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Flash Boys</strong> by <em>Michael Lewis</em>
        <p>
        I knew that high-frequency trading (HFT) was a thing, but I had no
        idea what is was all about. This book delivers a lot of eye-opening
        material. One company, hell-bent on finding the most direct path between
        futures markets in Chicago and the stock exchanges in New York City,
        wheels and deals and digs its way through the Midwest and Appalachia
        to shave milliseconds off communications, in an effort to land trades
        faster.

        The author describes all the counterintuitive incentives various stock
        exchanges offer to entice brokers to trade on them, later carefully
        explaining exactly why that was so. Further, the amount of information
        gleaned by exchanges and brokerages on where trades landed and in what
        amounts becomes rich data that provides insight into moves traders are
        looking to make.

        Finally, a plucky group of Wall Street folks come together to and bring
        fairness back to trading, by brinding issues to light and even starting
        their own exchange. This was a fascinating read. Michael Lewis' style
        kept the information approachable and the story flowing.

      <li><strong>Lefties: Former Title, Sinister People</strong> by <em>Jack Fincher</em>
        <p>
        I got this as a Christmas gift fom my in-laws (I'm left-handed) and I
        fully expected it'd be a so-you're-left-handed-here-are-other-notable-lefties
        type book. In reality, it blew my mind with the idea that the entire
        universe could be "handed" in one way, shape or form. Drawing on
        anthropology, physics, and psychology, the book goes deep into attempting
        to understand why handedness exists and whether there are benefits (or
        detriments) to either. The book is a bit dated and I'm sure there is a
        lot more science to draw on, but this was still and interesting, if
        sometimes heavy, book.
        </p>
      <li><strong>Innovator's Dilemma</strong> by <em>Clayton M. Christensen</em>
        <p>
        I picked this book up after a conversation with a colleague about business
        lifecycles. I've always been curious about the stages an organization goes
        through as it progresses from a startup and possibly on to a full-fledged
        blue chip. This book provides some really interesting analyses of several
        industries and the companies that existed, survived, and or folded based
        on how well they manage both sustaining and disruptive technologies. This
        has only whetted my appetite for learning more about business lifecycles.
        </p>
      <li><strong>The Big Short</strong> by <em>Michael Lewis</em>
        <p>
        I was really pleased with <strong>Flash Boys</strong> that I decided to
        pick this book up too. I didn't really know much about collateralized
        debt obligations (CDOs) and, honestly, I'm still not totally clear. But
        this story does a solid job describing the events and people that were
        involved in the subprime mortgage crisis that crashed. While I have some
        more research to do before I fully understand these complicated instruments,
        one insight I gleaned was that for an industry awash in data, not many
        people were able to analyze and classify CDOs (and related securities)
        at the granularity they needed. A lot was taken on faith and a lot was
        lost as a resut.

      <li><strong>The Field Guide to Understanding Human Error, 2nd Ed.</strong> by <em>Sidney Dekker</em>
        <p>
        Truth be told, I started this book last year, but I only finished it this
        Spring!
        </p>
        
        <p>
        This book is a must-read for all engineers, at a minimum. I think any
        professional can take away some new learnings from this book. If one
        learns nothing else but <b>how to better approach incidents with a
        non-judgemental outlook that aims to understand <em>why</em> people act how
        they do</b>, the read is worth it.
        </p>

        <p>
        Dekker's book describes the Old View (Bad Apple Theory)
        and New View of human factors study. Where the Old View seeks to assign
        blame to one or more individuals, the New View strives to understand
        <em>why</em> people make decisions and take actions in the face of challenges
        that have led to various accidents. Focusing on airline incidents (Mr.
        Dekker is a pilot), the reader comes to learn that hindsight bias is
        a powerful detractor from learning the truth. Hindsight does nothing to
        help explain what actors were experiencing, or what knowledge and experience
        led them to take the actions they did at the time. In other words, people
        act in a locally rational way: they did what made sense to them at the time.

        Endeavor to uncover the details of the unfolding situation, what people knew
        and were seeing, as well as the constraints they were operating in, and you
        stand a better chance of understanding what went wrong (and what went right)
        duing accidents. That information, in turn, can make a difference in 
        improving the systems and environments in which people operate.
