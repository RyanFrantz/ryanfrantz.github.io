# 2015 Reading

## Flash Boys by *Michael Lewis*

I knew that high-frequency trading (HFT) was a thing, but I had no
idea what is was all about. This book delivers a lot of eye-opening
material. One company, hell-bent on finding the most direct path between
futures markets in Chicago and the stock exchanges in New York City,
wheels and deals and digs its way through the Midwest and Appalachia
to shave milliseconds off communications, in an effort to land trades
faster.

The author describes all the counterintuitive incentives various stock
exchanges offer to entice brokers to trade on them, later carefully
explaining exactly why that was so. Further, the amount of information
gleaned by exchanges and brokerages on where trades landed and in what
amounts becomes rich data that provides insight into moves traders are
looking to make.

Finally, a plucky group of Wall Street folks come together to and bring
fairness back to trading, by brinding issues to light and even starting
their own exchange. This was a fascinating read. Michael Lewis' style
kept the information approachable and the story flowing.

## Lefties: Former Title, Sinister People by *Jack Fincher*

I got this as a Christmas gift fom my in-laws (I'm left-handed) and I
fully expected it'd be a so-you're-left-handed-here-are-other-notable-lefties
type book. In reality, it blew my mind with the idea that the entire
universe could be "handed" in one way, shape or form. Drawing on
anthropology, physics, and psychology, the book goes deep into attempting
to understand why handedness exists and whether there are benefits (or
detriments) to either. The book is a bit dated and I'm sure there is a
lot more science to draw on, but this was still and interesting, if
sometimes heavy, book.

## Innovator's Dilemma by *Clayton M. Christensen*

I picked this book up after a conversation with a colleague about business
lifecycles. I've always been curious about the stages an organization goes
through as it progresses from a startup and possibly on to a full-fledged
blue chip. This book provides some really interesting analyses of several
industries and the companies that existed, survived, and or folded based
on how well they manage both sustaining and disruptive technologies. This
has only whetted my appetite for learning more about business lifecycles.

## The Big Short by *Michael Lewis*

I was really pleased with Flash Boys that I decided to
pick this book up too. I didn't really know much about collateralized
debt obligations (CDOs) and, honestly, I'm still not totally clear. But
this story does a solid job describing the events and people that were
involved in the subprime mortgage crisis that crashed. While I have some
more research to do before I fully understand these complicated instruments,
one insight I gleaned was that for an industry awash in data, not many
people were able to analyze and classify CDOs (and related securities)
at the granularity they needed. A lot was taken on faith and a lot was
lost as a resut.

## The Field Guide to Understanding Human Error, 2nd Ed. by *Sidney Dekker*
 
Truth be told, I started this book last year, but I only finished it this
Spring!

This book is a must-read for all engineers, at a minimum. I think any
professional can take away some new learnings from this book. If one
learns nothing else but **how to better approach incidents with a
non-judgemental outlook that aims to understand *why* people act how
they do**, the read is worth it.

Dekker's book describes the Old View (Bad Apple Theory)
and New View of human factors study. Where the Old View seeks to assign
blame to one or more individuals, the New View strives to understand
*why* people make decisions and take actions in the face of challenges
that have led to various accidents. Focusing on airline incidents (Mr.
Dekker is a pilot), the reader comes to learn that hindsight bias is
a powerful detractor from learning the truth. Hindsight does nothing to
help explain what actors were experiencing, or what knowledge and experience
led them to take the actions they did at the time. In other words, people
act in a locally rational way: they did what made sense to them at the time.

Endeavor to uncover the details of the unfolding situation, what people knew
and were seeing, as well as the constraints they were operating in, and you
stand a better chance of understanding what went wrong (and what went right)
duing accidents. That information, in turn, can make a difference in 
improving the systems and environments in which people operate.

## Daring Greatly by *Bren√© Brown, Ph.D, LMSW*

At the end of 2014, [I wrote a post](/posts/be-vulnerable/) about
my experience truly making myself vulnerable in a work situation. My wife
read it and said, "Oh, you're gonna love this!" and handed me her copy of Dr.
Brown's Daring Greatly.

Dr. Brown studies what it means to be whole and human. She has
spent years working with people to understand the source and impact of shame
and what it can mean to embrace our vulnerability. She writes from a place
that is familiar, including offering up some of her own experiences. What
struck me most about the book was the way she gave equal time to issues of
vulnerability and shame faced by men and women, often the result of folks
having difficulty dealing with gender-specific behavior expectations.

I don't easily share my innermost feelings; this book declares there is
strength in doing so.

## Elon Musk - Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future by *Ashlee Vance*

This was a fun, fast biography following Elon Musk's (mostly recent) history,
accomplishments, and failures. I enjoyed it even though it appeared to be written
by someone smitten with the subject.

## At Day's Close - Night in Times Past by *A. Roger Ekirch*

I initially picked up this book because
[I'm really interested in sleep](/posts/sleep-driven-development/).
The author describes how people used
to sleep in two distinct phases: the first started at dusk and ended somewhere
in the middle of the night, whereupon folks would talk, play games,
visit friends, and more, before retiring for the second sleep.

Mr. Ekirch cobbles together a picture of night life before the light bulb
using information gleaned from diaries and public records. It's fascinating
as it details how much has changed since the introduction of artificial
light while at the same time recognizing that many aspects of life
are much the same as they've always been after the sun goes down.

## The Signal and the Noise by *Nate Silver*

I learned of Nate Silver during the 2012 U.S. election cycle where he had
an impressive track record predicting the outcomes of nearly every race
he reviewed, including the presidential contest. Eager to learn more about
his methods, I thought I'd give this book a try.

It was very interesting to learn that Mr. Silver started out tracking baseball
statistics and developing software to help gauge scouting strategies. He
later parlayed his experience there into politics. Currently he and his team
lay out their predicitions at
[fivethirtyeight.com](http://fivethirtyeight.com/).

I got a decent introduction to Bayesian analysis (enough to whet my appetite
for more). The most important takeaway from the book was that for any given
forecast, it's important to be a little skeptical, being mindful of the quality
of data used as inputs and understanding what, if any, underlying biases and
motivations go into making such predictions.

## Augie and the Green Knight by *Zach Weinersmith*

Ostensibly, I backed this Kickstarter project for the kids. As I read a
chapter to them each night, it became apparent it was a little old for them
(they're in 1st grade and kindergarten). Honestly, I don't think they
appreciated the dad jokes as much as I did!

I finished the book myself and loved it. Augie is a smart, plucky girl
that goes on an adventure in the forest behind her house. She comes across
a giant and decides to teach him and his kingdom about science and
government. It's quite a silly story that is very enjoyable. Notably, it's
the only fiction book I read this year. For myself, at least.

It also features gorgeous illustrations by Boulet.
