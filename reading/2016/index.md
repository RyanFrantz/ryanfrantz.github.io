# 2016 Reading

* **what if?** by *Randall Munroe*

    If you're a fan of [xkcd](http://xkcd.com/) you'll love this book. Munroe
    started the the [what if?](https://what-if.xkcd.com/) site to field and
    answer off-the-wall physics and math questions from folks. He compiled many of
    those, and their answers, into **what if?** It's a fun read, filled with lots
    of compelling scenarios and humorously-answered responses.

* **A Million Miles in a Thousand Years** by *Donald Miller*

    This book came as a recommendation from my wife. I wasn't sure what to expect
    but I read it anyway. In it, the author describes how, while learning to write
    a more compelling story, he learned to approach his life in the same way. All
    good stories have tension and struggle. Characters are defined by their
    experiences and how they react to them.
    
    The author felt his own life was boring and unsatisfactory, two things he
    suspected would lead to a decline in his ability to continue as a compelling
    author. In order to live a more satisfying life, he decided to find and live
    new experiences, especially those that provided tension and uncertainty.

    I enjoyed this book because it left with the idea that it's not enough to
    go after our dreams. It's just as important to seek out experiences that take
    us out of our comfort zone so that we can truly grow as humans. Then we can
    write truly compelling stories.

* **Thinking in Systems** by *Donella H. Meadows*

    I had learned from past experiences to approach (computer) systems and their
    design holistically, but this book gave me new ways of, well, thinking in
    systems. Now I see stocks, inputs/outputs, and feedback loops everywhere!

    I posted several ideas about [systems thinking in practice](/posts/systems-thinking-in-practice/)
    as a result.

    Whether you're new to your career or an old hand, pick up a copy of this book
    and I bet you'll find useful guidance in how you approach your work.

* **The Year Without Pants** by *Scott Berkun*

    I picked this book up because I work remotely and I was curious what someone
    else had to say about the lifestyle (there are no shortage of opinions on this
    topic online, of course). It was compelling for me because Berkun compared the
    transition from an in-office experience to 100% remote, the same I'd done when
    I started working for Etsy 3 years ago. He reflected the same feelings and
    concerns I had at the beginning: uncertainty about how my progress would be
    measured; not knowing if my ideas and communications were being ingested or
    ignored; anxiety about feeling alienated and alone in my home office.

    The book primarily explores Automattic, in general, and WordPress.com, in
    particular. Specifically, Berkun details the experiment that was him coming
    on board to determine if creating small teams made sense as the company grew.
    Was a flat hierarchy still tenable? Could teams meet the demands of a growing
    company? Would people balk at the structure?

    The stories were generally interesting and I felt a sense of camraderie for
    the characters involved. Despite that, while I can't quite put my finger on
    it at the moment, the book felt just a tad superficial; it felt like an
    honest and transparent look into how Automattic behaved and also felt like
    a carefully curated expose.
