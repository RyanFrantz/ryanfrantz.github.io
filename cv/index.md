I'm seeking engineering management (director-level and above) roles to continue
**progressing toward becoming a CTO**. I'm interested in well-established
companies looking to improve their engineering processes and startups that have
found product market fit and need to scale. I'm an engineering leader by trade,
a translator by practice. I distill business strategy into engineering direction
and convert engineering outcomes into business value.

A sample of my achievements includes delivering the backend for **a long-running,
FDA-reviewed, clinical trial**; shipping a backwards-compatible authentication
solution for a **1-million-user consumer application**; kickstarting a security and
compliance program, targeting SOC 2 compliance, to position a SaaS startup for
enterprise customers;  building a cross-platform CI rig, and related tooling, to
support development of products that **impact global financial markets**; designing
and managing the architecture necessary to operate a medical management
company's nationwide mission of raising the bar for patient care and
simultaneously reducing total healthcare costs.

I dive into my roles, identifying key outcomes, and prioritizing work to deliver
the team's mission. **When the path is clear I'm a force multiplier; in the face
of ambiguity I set a course**. I do the hard work, the necessary work. And I
create the conditions necessary to support focus, so that **we work on the right
thing at the right time**.

# Experience

## Lumos Labs - Engineering Director
### 10/2020 - Present
* Developed an execution strategy using personas and user story mapping, that
improved the engineers' delivery capability as they rewrote our core consumer
web app. **We shipped an early version of the web app to India and the
Philippines**.
  * Working in 1-week cycles, the team increased velocity from **1 feature per
  month to 2 features delivered roughly every 2 weeks**.
* Shipped important medical and research products that served our
[long-term strategy](https://www.lumoslabs.com/digital-medicine) to expand into
more markets, including:
  * A fully-documented backend for an 18-month FDA-reviewed clinical trial to
  **validate a potential ADHD digital therapeutic**.
  * A web application for **an active double-blind study of 10,000 participants**
  to detect biomarkers that might support early diagnosis of multiple sclerosis.
* Managed, coached, and promoted **15 engineers** across a breadth of
specialties including data engineering, infrastructure, web and backend
development, and Corp IT.
* Reshaped the interview process to extract stronger signal from candidates in
fewer cycles, **growing the web and platform teams from 2 engineers to 8**
in an extremely competitive talent market.
* Created and staffed a security and compliance function to manage our bug
bounty program, provide regular training, and to shape early controls ahead of
bringing a digital therapeutic product to market.

## Jeli, Inc. - Co-founder and CTO
### 8/2019 - 9/2020
* Laid the technical foundation for cloud-first development of a product that
aids teams learning from their software incidents. Combined 12-factor
application principles, containerized workloads, and AWS services like ECS in
a strategy to minimize operational overhead and focus on delivering valuable
features. 
* Established an early security and compliance program to position the company
for a SOC 2 Type 2 attestation that would appeal to early customers.

## Bloomberg, L.P. - Senior Software Engineer
### 3/2017 - 8/2019
* Managed projects, provided architectural guidance, and engineering expertise
to develop a storage automation project that reduced a request backlog from 1
week to 1 day and eliminated a $1M service contract.
* Designed and implemented a CI platform supporting 4 operating systems,
configuration management solutions (Chef, Salt) and multiple projects written in
Python, Ruby, and Go. After onboarding 100 repos in 3 months, engineers and
management were more confident in their updates, detecting common/recurring
bugs, and following consistent testing practices.

## Etsy, Inc. - Staff Operations Engineer
### 1/2013 - 3/2017
* Partnered with product teams to help them focus operational effort in support
of their work including preparing feature launches and honing reliability
practices. By describing a minimum set of required outcomes and training to
realize them, I provided a clear roadmap to teams that enabled them to
consistently deliver reliable features.
* Led architecture reviews, operational readiness efforts, and facilitated
incident debriefings to drive an holistic approach to systems thinking and
continuous learning.
* Contributed open source tooling in the monitoring space and encouraged the
industry to think differently about alert design and the on-call experience.

## Conifer Health Solutions (Tenet Healthcare) - Technical Services Director
### 1/2004 - 1/2013
* **Established and grew an Engineering team (0 to 10)** to build and operate the
infrastructure powering healthcare products such as:
  * Online enrollment for dental, medical, and vision plans.
  * Third-party administration of dental, medical, and vision claims via LuminX.
  * Data warehousing and ETL processing for predictive analysis of plan costs.
  * Medical case management and care coordination delivered by clinicians (RNs)
  nationwide.
* Collaborated with facilities management to build and expand on-premises data
center operations.
* Provided all telecommunications management including bundling T1s, PSTN lines,
and a VoIP-based unified messaging platform to deliver both our online presence
and toll-free based services for over 100 customers.
* Drafted, performed, and audited all necessary technical controls to maintain
HIPAA compliance on an annual basis.

## Ebix Health - Senior System Administrator
### 10/1998 - 1/2004
* As a value-added reseller, we bundled our medical claims-processing software
(LuminX) with nearly every version of proprietary UNIX (AIX, HP-UX, Solaris,
Tru64), Linux, and Windows.
* Provided post-sales engineering design, implementation, and ongoing support to
customers. The scope of this work included:
  * Integrating with their existing backend infrastructure.
  * Rolling out front office workstations (Windows NT and 2000) and scanning
  stations to generate OCR images of paper claims.
  * Implementing short- and long-term storage (disk and WORM media, respectively)
  that satisfied regulatory requirements. 

# Miscellany
## Conference Presentations

I am fascinated by the prospect of people using computers to augment their
activities during incidents. I’ve given several presentations on tooling I’ve
built to support on-call engineers, alert design, and how we might apply
concepts from Cognitive Systems Engineering to improve the state of the art.

* [Designing Alerts to Direct Attention](https://ryanfrantz.com/talks/designing-alerts-direct-attention/) describes Cognitive Systems Engineering concepts and their application in designing alerts.
  * [https://ryanfrantz.com/talks/designing-alerts-direct-attention/](https://ryanfrantz.com/talks/designing-alerts-direct-attention/)
* [It’s 3AM, Do You Know Why You Got Paged?](https://ryanfrantz.com/talks/3am-why-you-got-paged) dives into alert design and ways we can aid on-call engineers’ ability to orient themselves. I introduce nagios-herald and illustrate how it applies these ideas.
  * [https://ryanfrantz.com/talks/3am-why-you-got-paged/](https://ryanfrantz.com/talks/3am-why-you-got-paged/)
* In [Mean Time to Sleep](https://ryanfrantz.com/talks/mtts/), a colleague and I discuss quantifying the on-call experience and tooling we’ve built to aid engineers.

* I've also collected [thoughts on software engineering](https://github.com/ryanfrantz/engineering) that I occasionally update.

## Open Source Software

I’ve open-sourced a few tools I hoped might be useful to others.

* `nagios-herald` is a project that supports adding context to alerts to help orient on-call engineers.
  * See [https://github.com/etsy/nagios-herald](https://github.com/etsy/nagios-herald)

* `chef-umami` provides a low-friction way to get started writing tests for Chef cookbooks by doing it _for_ you!
