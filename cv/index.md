For 25 years I have been practicing software development (predominantly backend
with frontend work as needed) and web operations, holding roles in management
and as an individual contributor. I've worked across a wide range of companies,
from startups to large organizations, covering a breadth of industries including
healthcare, e-commerce, fintech, and gaming.

I dive into my roles, identifying key outcomes, and prioritizing work to deliver
the team's mission. When the path is clear I'm a force multiplier; in the face
of ambiguity I set a course. I do the hard work, the boring work. And I create
the conditions necessary to support focus, so that we work on the right thing at
the right time.

# Experience

## Lumos Labs - Engineering Director
### 10/2020 - Present
* Developed an execution strategy that improved the engineers' delivery
capability and increased team velocity as they rewrote our core consumer app.
* Shipped critical medical and research products that served our long-term
strategy to expand into more markets.
* Reshaped the interview process to extract stronger signal from candidates in
fewer cycles and hit all of our hiring goals in an extremely competitive talent
market.
* Managed engineers across a breadth of specialties including data engineering,
infrastructure, web and backend development, security, and Corp IT.

## Jeli, Inc. - Co-founder and CTO
### 8/2019 - 9/2020
* Laid the technical foundation for cloud-first development of a product that
aids teams learning from their software incidents. Combined 12-factor
application principles, containerized workloads, and AWS services like ECS in
a strategy to minimize operational overhead and focus on delivering valuable
features. 
* Established an early security and compliance program to position the company
for a SOC 2 Type 2 attestation that would appeal to early customers.

## Bloomberg, L.P. - Senior Software Engineer
### 3/2017 - 8/2019
* Managed projects, provided architectural guidance, and engineering expertise to develop a storage automation project that reduced a request backlog from 1 week to 1 day and eliminated a $1M service contract.
* Designed and implemented a CI platform supporting 4 operating systems, configuration management solutions (Chef, Salt) and multiple projects written in Python, Ruby, and Go. After onboarding 100 repos in 3 months, engineers and management were more confident in their updates, detecting common/recurring bugs, and following consistent testing practices.

## Etsy, Inc. - Staff Operations Engineer
### 1/2013 - 3/2017
* Partnered with product teams to help them focus operational effort in support of their work including preparing feature launches and honing reliability practices. By describing a minimum set of required outcomes and training to realize them, I provided a clear roadmap to teams that enabled them to consistently deliver reliable features.
* Led architecture reviews, operational readiness efforts, and facilitated incident debriefings to drive an holistic approach to systems thinking and continuous learning.
* Contributed open source tooling in the monitoring space and encouraged the industry to think differently about alert design and the on-call experience.

## Conifer Health Solutions - Technical Services Director (Previously InforMed, LLC)
### 1/2004 - 1/2013
* Established and grew a Systems Engineering team to support the long-term technical needs of the clinician, customer service, and claims administration departments. We built and implemented low-friction solutions that supported the mission of providing high-quality care at reduced costs.
* Built a Support Desk team, setting service levels for response time and quality, to provide regular assistance to clinicians spread across the country.

## Ebix Health - Senior System Administrator
### 10/1998 - 1/2004
* Provided post-sales engineering design, implementation, and support to customers including managing onsite customer installations across a range of platforms.

# Miscellany
## Conference Presentations

I am fascinated by the prospect of people using computers to augment their activities during incidents. I’ve given several presentations on tooling I’ve built to support on-call engineers, alert design, and how we might apply concepts from Cognitive Systems Engineering to improve the state of the art.

* [Designing Alerts to Direct Attention](https://ryanfrantz.com/talks/designing-alerts-direct-attention/) describes Cognitive Systems Engineering concepts and their application in designing alerts.
  * [https://ryanfrantz.com/talks/designing-alerts-direct-attention/](https://ryanfrantz.com/talks/designing-alerts-direct-attention/)
* [It’s 3AM, Do You Know Why You Got Paged?](https://ryanfrantz.com/talks/3am-why-you-got-paged) dives into alert design and ways we can aid on-call engineers’ ability to orient themselves. I introduce nagios-herald and illustrate how it applies these ideas.
  * [https://ryanfrantz.com/talks/3am-why-you-got-paged/](https://ryanfrantz.com/talks/3am-why-you-got-paged/)
* In [Mean Time to Sleep](https://ryanfrantz.com/talks/mtts/), a colleague and I discuss quantifying the on-call experience and tooling we’ve built to aid engineers.

## Blog Posts

I write occasionally. These are some samples of my posts.
* [Incident Analysis and Chaos Engineering: Complementary Practices](https://www.learningfromincidents.io/posts/incident-analysis-and-chaos-engineering)
* [Remote Incident Response](https://ryanfrantz.com/posts/remote-incident-response.html)
* [When Does an Investigation End?](https://ryanfrantz.com/posts/when-does-an-investigation-end.html)
* I've also collected [thoughts on software engineering](https://github.com/ryanfrantz/engineering) that I ocassionally update.

## Open Source Software

I’ve open-sourced a few tools I hoped might be useful to others.

* `nagios-herald` is a project that supports adding context to alerts to help orient on-call engineers.
  * See [https://github.com/etsy/nagios-herald](https://github.com/etsy/nagios-herald)

* `chef-umami` provides a low-friction way to get started writing tests for Chef cookbooks by doing it _for_ you!
  * See [https://github.com/bloomberg/chef-umami](https://github.com/bloomberg/chef-umami)
