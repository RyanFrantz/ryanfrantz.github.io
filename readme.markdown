# Southpaw

Southpaw is my hack of Zach Holman's [Left](https://github.com/holman/left) layout for [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll).

Most of my updates are in the fonts (I'm using the OpenSans family) and CSS that I shamelessly took from Holman's site that I liked
(and didn't see in the CSS of this project!).
