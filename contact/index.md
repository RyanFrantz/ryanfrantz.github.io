I'm a software engineer by trade, a translator by practice. I distill business
outcomes into engineering direction and convert engineering outcomes into
business value.

This has included: delivering the backend for a long-running, FDA-reviewed,
clinical trial; shipping a backwards-compatible authentication solution for a,
1-million-user consumer application; kickstarting a security and compliance
program, targeting SOC 2 compliance, to position a SaaS startup for enterprise
customers;  building a cross-platform CI rig, and related tooling, to support
development of products that impact global financial markets; designing and
managing the architecture necessary to operate a medical management company's
nationwide mission of raising the bar for patient care and simultaneously
reducing total healthcare costs.
