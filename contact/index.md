For 25 years I have been practicing software development (predominantly backend with frontend work as needed)
and web operations, holding roles in management and as an individual contributor.
I've worked across a wide range of companies, from startups to large organizations, covering a breadth of
industries including healthcare, e-commerce, fintech, and gaming.
