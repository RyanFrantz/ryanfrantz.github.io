Find my CV [here](/cv).

I am a product-oriented engineering manager. My multifaceted career has been
driven by the desire to close the distance between my engineering work and the
customer experience.

From my time as a sysadmin starting 25 years ago, during my web operations
experience at e-commerce and fintech companies, while designing systems to
operate reliably at scale, through crafting engineering teams and processes to
deliver software and systems I have learned to combine people management,
knowledge of scalable infrastructure, and product development into one clear
mission statement: engineering is the product.

My contributions have included:
<ul>
<li>
delivering the backend for a long-running, FDA-reviewed, clinical trial;
</li>
<li>
shipping a backwards-compatible authentication solution for a 1-million-user
consumer application;
</li>
<li>
kickstarting a security and compliance program, targeting SOC 2 compliance, to
position a SaaS startup for enterprise customers;
</li>
<li>
building a cross-platform CI rig, and related tooling, to support development of
products that impact global financial markets;
</li>
<li>
designing and managing the architecture necessary to operate a medical
management company's nationwide mission of raising the bar for patient care and
simultaneously reducing total healthcare costs.
</li>
</ul>
