## Continuous Culture

Culture is always evolving and doesn't come for free. This is the story of
Etsy's journey from 4-person startup to an international organization and the
culture that we all work to foster.

## It's 3AM, Do You Know Why You Got Paged?

When it’s three in the morning, it’s hard enough waking up, let alone getting
your brain in gear to fix problems. Computers should provide us with additional
context around an alert, so that we can resolve issues faster and get back to
sleep. This presentation discusses how to contextualize alerts automatically,
so that engineers can address issues faster and get back to what they were
doing.

## Mean Time to Sleep

Laurie Denness and I gave a presentation at Velocity Santa Clara wherein we
discussed the ways Etsy's Operations team worked to improve the on-call
experience for our fellow engineers.

## Influencing Cultural Change

Here I share my experiences working to build influence and effect positive
cultural change at a past employer. I focus on the relationship between the
Operations team I built and the Development team with whom we needed to
collaborate to meet the needs of the business.

## Web Load Balancing

This is my presentation from LOPSA-East 2013 where I reviewed a load balancing
solution I built using nginx, haproxy, and keepalived.

## How I Tried to Change Culture and Failed

This was a lightning talk I gave a LOPSA Baltimore. (My apologies for the bad
audio; I wasn't always close to the mic, being the effervescent talker
that I am...)
