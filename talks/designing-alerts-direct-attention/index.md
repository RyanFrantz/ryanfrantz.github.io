# Designing Alerts to Direct Attention

Many of the alerts monitoring systems send us are primitive capture events
lacking useful context that can aid our response. In this presentation I discuss
joint cognitive systems, humans’ executive functions, and recommend ideas that
challenge the audience to think about designing their alerts to support humans’
mental abilities.

A long form version of this topic is available in my post
[Designing Alerts to Direct Attention](/posts/designing-alerts-to-direct-attention.html).
