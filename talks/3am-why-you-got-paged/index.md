#It's 3AM, Do You Know Why You Got Paged?

When it’s three in the morning, it’s hard enough waking up, let alone
getting your brain in gear to fix problems. Computers should provide
us with additional context around an alert, so that we can resolve issues
faster and get back to sleep. This presentation discusses how to contextualize
alerts automatically, so that engineers can address issues faster and get back
to what they were doing.
