#Continuous Culture

Culture is always evolving and doesn't come for free. This is the story of
Etsy's journey from 4-person startup to an international organization and
the culture that we all work to foster.

I was invited by the [U.S. Patent and Trade Office](http://www.uspto.gov/) to
speak at a meetup they sponsored at their offices. The USPTO is one of the first
U.S. government agencies to host such a public event so I was honored to attend.

It even got picked up by [FedScoop](http://fedscoop.com/):
