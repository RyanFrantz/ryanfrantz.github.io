  <h2><a href="/talks/influencing-cultural-change/">Influencing Cultural Change</a></h2>
  <p>
    Here I share my experiences working to build influence and effect positive cultural change at a past employer.
    I focus on the relationship between the Operations team I built and the Development team with whom we needed to collaborate
    to meet the needs of the business.
