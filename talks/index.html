  <h2>Influencing Cultural Change</h2>
  <p>
    Here I share my experiences working to build influence and effect positive cultural change at a past employer.
    I focus on the relationship between the Operations team I built and the Development team with whom we needed to collaborate
    to meet the needs of the business.

  The video from this lightning talk is below.  (My apologies for the bad audio; I wasn't always close to the mic, being the effervescent talker that I am...)
