"Good code doesn't need comments."

"We'll remove the conversations in this doc and publish a clean version."

I wonder if this sentiment is driven by a concern that the conversations that
shape work are messy and not appropriate for some “final” output.

If so, I submit that those messy details _are_ the work and they _are_ worthy of
inclusion in the final product.

Somewhat related to this ideal (the work is messy and the mess is the work) is
the art form of [kintsugi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kintsugi). The product
of that work includes breaks and blemishes. It resonates with me because that
work is not perfect; it retains the imperfections of the overall piece.

Crucially, it tells an [important story](/posts/writing-directs-attention).

Mess is necessary to understanding. Mess is beautiful.
