I read [@itsa_talia](https://twitter.com/itsa_talia)'s recent
[open letter to her CEO](https://medium.com/@taliajane/an-open-letter-to-my-ceo-fb73df021e7a#.8hhegi90v)
and almost kept on going about my business, scrolling through my feeds, catching
up with life after a few days off. But I caught some comments here and there
and a smattering of not-so-subtle subtweets that stuck with me. The pattern of
a person posting an idea online and the resulting negative comments play out
every day on the Internet. I think we can do better.

First, to Talia: Thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts and
issue with us. You didn't have to. Also, it can be scary putting things out in
the world, but you are brave, and you **did** it.

To the rest of us, let's step back and reflect rather than judge right or wrong
on the part of anyone. If we do, we'll recognize that we don't (perhaps won't)
have the complete story and therefore can't possibly know or fully understand
either party's motivations for their actions. Let's seek to balance the discussion
rather than making statements that further our own points of view.

I've jotted down some of my reflections below.

## Themes and Ideas

In the various comments and tweets related to Talia's post, I saw several
recurring negative themes and ideas. Herein I attempt to illicit balance
by providing an alternate point of view.

### You Made Bad Choices

Several folks stated that Talia had exercised poor judgment in deciding to:

1. Live on her own, thus having to pay rent.
2. Choose a college degree that's inadequate to find gainful employment.
3. Believe it is reasonable to expect to live off her paycheck.

I could spend time on each of these (especially because they insinuate the
author is not bright) but in the end, it all comes down to the following:

**We ALL make mistakes at some point in our lives; it's how we learn.**

That having been said, whether Talia's choices were mistakes is up to **her**
to interpret. For us, it should be enough to know she has the agency to make
her own decisions.

### You *Knew* This was a Low-paying Job

This is related to the above theme but I wanted to point this out specifically
because we know nothing of Talia's career plans. Perhaps she had a larger goal
of advancing in the organization to do something she enjoyed. She did mention
an interest/ability in making food-related memes and jokes. It's very likely
she saw her customer service position as entree to a different role in the future.

### You're Whining

This does nothing but serve to quiet the author. It does not further the
conversation or acknowledge the subject matter. Further, [Medium](https://medium.com)'s
reason for being is to provide a platform for people to voice their ideas and
opinions. Given the choice to suffer in silence or voice her discontent, it's
healthier (for everyone) that she chose the latter.

### You're Entitled

This was either stated explicitly or inferred by classifying the author as a
'millennial'. Much like labeling her a 'whiner', this sort of comment seeks to
silence or deflect the conversation.

With respect to Talia's access to snacks and drinks in her office (as several
whine-related comments chose to focus attention), this cannot
be reasonably used to define her as entitled. Many employers choose to offer 
refreshments as a bid to be competitive among other companies for talent; some simply
enjoy feeding their staff. It's true that not everyone enjoys such
a benefit but claiming that she's entitled (or taking advantage) for receiving
snacks is no different than claiming entitlement for one who regularly visits
their doctor because they have medical insurance. Also, it's not much of a benefit
if it's not used; nothing is gained from begrudging a person for doing so.

### You're Bad-Mouthing Your Employer

I can understand how some would feel this way, especially her employer. It's
reasonable to assume folks in Talia's organization were not pleased with her post.
However, we don't know much about what she tried to do internally before posting
to Medium. She does mention making some recommendations that were declined, but we
don't know what, if anything, else she may have tried, including conversations
with her manager or HR.

### She Got What She Deserved

Talia's post concludes with an update that she's been terminated. Some folks
are quick to quip that she deserved this outcome. In her Twitter feed, she mentions
that HR claimed she violated the Terms of Conduct policy as part of her
employment. I cannot speak to her specific circumestances but I will hazard an
opinion on policies, in general.

Policies can be "useful"...:

* ... when they help inform or guide positive behaviors we want to see in our
coworkers, when goodwill and love drive those that enforce them.
* ... to hide behind, when fear and shame control the reactions of those that
enfoce them.

Was her employer's reaction to be expected? Perhaps. Humans tend to react poorly
in many negative situations. In an attempt to avoid pain we will distance
ourselves from the source of discomfort. All we learn, unfortunately, is how to
avoid pain, not to heal or prevent it.

In any case *someone* didn't appreciate what she had to say, the way she said it,
or the media within which she chose to say it. Someone was embarrassed and/or
angry and chose to cite and execute company policy. 

## A Conversation

For the moment, I'm going to make an assumption that the events surrounding
Talia's termination are in direct response to her post. Doing so allows me to
describe how I imagine a better course of action could take place. I am,
admittedly, taking license to make a point.

Yelp could have chosen to step back and reflect, considering the author's post,
digesting her points, and starting a conversation:

    Yelp: We hear you, Talia. It hurt to read the things you wrote
    in public, but we're listening.

    Talia: Thank you for saying so. I recognize it was painful to
    be exposed this way.

    Yelp: We'd like to sit down with you to agree on how we can work
    together to address these issues. Where would you like to start?

From there, both Talia and Yelp might be able to find common ground. Key to this
dialogue is both parties [being vulnerable](/posts/be-vulnerable/) and honest
about the situation, their motivations, and what they are willing to do to address
the issues.

Such a conversation would be very constructive and collaborative. For Yelp's part
it would demonstrate they care about their employees, are willing to do the hard
things, and sets an excellent example for other organizations to follow. For Talia,
she may be able to effect the change she wants to see. Both would learn and grow
from the experience.

## A Note About Customer Service

Unless you've worked in any sort of customer-facing role, especially jobs strictly
defined as 'customer service representative', you can't know what the day-to-day workload is like.
Some days, in such a role, there will be folks you help that are happy with
the outcome of their request, and they may even say so. But by and large, the
requests customer service folks handle can be very negative. Unfortunately,
customer service representatives are almost always the target of any hostility,
simply because they are the face of the organization for a given point of contact.

Consider that the author, in conjunction with the stress of being unable to pay
her bills, was also dealing with constant negativity every day. Such an environment
takes its toll on a person. Perhaps her combined frustrations built up to a point
that she needed to vent. I'm thankful she decided to *write* about it, rather than
some other action (I noted her comment about her reasons for leaving the last place
she lived).

## Make a Choice

We can **choose** how we treat other people. We can simply attempt to avoid pain
and react by denigrating a person for their choices, ability, or skills. Or we
can step back, reflect on what it means to be part of a community, to understand
other people's motivations, and respond with empathy and care.
