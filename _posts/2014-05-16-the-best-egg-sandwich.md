I think I make the **best** egg sandwich. Why? Because it's simple, fast, and tasty. And I want to share it with you.

What really makes my egg sandwiches the best is partly the ingredients, but mostly, the following:

* Prepatation
* Timing

Now, to the making.

### Ingredients

* 1 egg
* 2 pats of salted butter
* 1 slice of cheese [[1]](#1)
* 2 slices of bread [[2]](#2)

### Steps

1.  Get a plate and a small bowl.
2.  Beat a single egg in the bowl, place in a microwave, and set the timer for 60 seconds.
3.  Slice two thin pats of butter and set them on the edge of the plate.
4.  Set cheese slice on the side of the plate.
5.  Toast your bread to a medium brown.
6.  **As soon** as the bread pops, pull the slices and place the pats in the center of each so that they can start to melt.
 * The thinner the pat, the faster it melts.
7.  Start the microwave.
8.  Spread the butter on the toast and place the cheese on a slice so that it can start to melt a bit.
9.  When the microwave is finished, carefully extract the egg (it should be nice and fluffy) and place it on the slice with the cheese.
10.  Place the other slice on top of the sandwich and wait 60 seconds.

What you get is a crisp, warm, fluffy egg, cheese-melty experience that's ready in minutes with little cleanup.

Enjoy!
