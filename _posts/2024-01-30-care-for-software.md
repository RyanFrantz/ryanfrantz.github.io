I used to agree that every line of code is a liability. After reflecting on
this, I see software less as a liability and more a responsibility. Meaning,
care is required.

At all stages of software's lifecycle.

We care as we develop, care as we operate and scale, and care as we deprecate.

Good care requires lots of resources.
