An unordered, likely incomplete set of activities I engage in on a weekly basis
as an Engineering Director:

- Defining short- and long-term strategy
- Making and supporting space for engineers to think through problems
- Celebrating when the team delivers, including exploratory demos
- Injecting energy to help sustain a distributed team
- Consolidating redundant tools
- Highlighting and amplifying positive behaviors
- Budgeting
- Advocating for safety in word and deed
- Identifying skill gaps and finding ways to address them
- Gauging team and individual performance
    - Keeping an eye out for signs of burnout, rabbit-holing, and overall
      sentiment
- Trying to put a finger on the current cognitive load
- Providing constraints in an ambiguous problem space
- Soliciting feedback on projects and plans
- Establishing criteria to evaluate new tools and processes
- Nurturing an evolving Engineering org and helping it discover/define itself
- Minor administrative tasks like reviewing and approving expenses
- Remembering to eat
- Interviewing candidates
    - Shaping up interview processes to make it less stressful for everyone and
      more consistent in an effort to overcome biases
- Reconciling short-term goal setting with long-term forecasting
- Translating outcomes up and down the org stack
- Reading and talking about how others in the industry face management and
  organzational challenges
