Change management procedures are borne from a fear of change. The controls
related to this "management" afford an avoidance of understanding proposed
changes, bolstering that fear.

As a group makes time to understand changes and their expected impact, they
learn to describe them more effectively. This leads to less fear of change. And
as each change is implemented, the group has an opportunity to calibrate their
descriptions (models).

Then, as the group's collective confidence grows around change events, when
failures occur, reactions from fear are attenuated (they're never dissipated
fully). Curiosity gets a foot hold and learning gets a leg up.
