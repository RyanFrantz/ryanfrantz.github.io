## If You're White...

...then this post is specifically for you. You and I have work to do to address
systemic racism in the United States of America. Ready yourself to learn, to be
uncomfortable, and to act based on what you have learned and what is making you
uncomfortable.

## Black Lives Matter

Nineteen days ago, on May 25, 2020,
[George Floyd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Floyd) was murdered by
officers of the Minneapolis Police Department responding to a call alleging
Floyd had paid for goods with a counterfeit twenty-dollar bill. In other words,
a man lost his life due to the unrestrained application of lethal force by
police over a possibly fake $20.

Since then, amazing numbers of people around the U.S. and the world have risked
both infection from COVID-19 and harm from police response by protesting. You
may be seeing less of the protests on the media, if at all, but folks are still
in the streets making their voices heard. More importantly, they're speaking up
for George Floyd. And Breonna Taylor. And Ahmaud Arbery. And Eric Garner. And
Trayvon Martin. All people who cannot speak for themselves now.

You may hear "Black Lives Matter" (BLM) and react, "ALL lives matter!" To an
extent, you would be valid, because **life matters**, full stop. We should
respect all lives. With this framing, hopefully it becomes clear that the phrase
"black lives matter" is an attempt to **focus attention on the reality that we
aren't respecting all lives equally**. Responding that all lives matter
de-emphasizes the message of BLM and this is harmful because it does not
recognize what is happening to black lives every day.

When Michael J. Fox advocates for Parkinson's, there is no outcry from
Alzheimer's or Huntington's supporters that all degenerative neurological
diseases matter. That much is understood. And it's also understood that Michael
J. Fox is doing what he can to bring awareness to a major part of his life that
needs attention, a part that, for him and many others, is a matter of life and
death. "Black Lives Matter" also draws attention to the life and death of black
Americans.

## The Work

Let's assume that you read the above and you fully agree. You've even said so
on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram. Maybe you've donated to a group that
supports BLM or a bail fund. These are a good start but they're just a start.
Because, you see, friend, we've got a lot of work to do dismantling systemic
racism. And when I say "work", I well and truly mean the kind of effort that
requires a daily commitment. That commitment may make it feel tedious,
especially if we don't see immediate results, but we have to keep it up because
**if you're black in America, you never get a break**.

If it seems daunting, consider this: if you practice meditation or prayer,
regularly exercise or do yoga, or are studying a new language, you already
recognize that in order to get closer to a fuller understanding, you need to
consistently invest your time and energy. It is the same to do the work to
understand critical topics like systemic racism, privilege, and
intersectionality.

### A Plan

In the context of this post words need to be followed with action. It may be
unclear, however, what actions to take. To help, I'm sharing my plan. I've
broken it down into things I can do right now, in the near term, and the future.
Finally, I highlight some behaviors that may need addressing throughout this
work.

This is by no means a perfect or exhaustive plan. It is a set of actions I've
compiled to help me gauge my progress. Throughout this work I aim to learn more
about:

* The lived experiences of others.
* What privilege means.
* How that privilege can be used (directly or indirectly; consciously or
  unconsciously) to support systemic racism.
* How that privilege may be harnessed to support those at a disadvantage.

#### Things To Do Now

* Donate to funds supporting those doing the work including BLM and bail funds.
  * Consider making regular (i.e. monthly donations) for continued support.
* Seek out alternative perspectives. Locate and follow accounts on social
  media (and elsewhere) of people that are different than me. This means folks that
  may not be white, heterosexual, or cisgender. It means folks that may not be
  physically able as I am, such as due to blindness, deafness, or any number
  of mobility issues. And there is a range of folks that may not be considered
  neuro-typical.
* Listen to those perspectives start listening. Truly hear their experiences
  and choose to believe them. Imagine myself in their shoes.
* Prepare myself to feel shame and guilt, even if I've done nothing overt.
  By our inaction, we permit systematic issues to persist.

#### Things To Start Doing (Because They'll Take Time)

* Read up on the subject of racism, privilege, systemic oppression, the history
  of race in America, and more. Source as many people as possible, but
  specifically from PoC. The Internet has made so much useful content so
  accessible. Use it. Where applicable, support writers and content creators by
  paying for their books, for example.
* Get involved in my community, starting with my neighbors.

#### Things To Do in the Future

* Hold my representatives, senators, and other officials to account. 
* **Vote**.
* Vote for PoC and women. Add a broader range of people and with them their
  experiences and perspectives. They will help us realize the change that is so
  necessary to growing through this.
* Vote out reactionary, jingoistic, puerile, and ignorant politicians.
* Hire PoC and promote them into more roles. If there is a bar you are concerned
  about, know that they've likely performed well above that for some time
  because they are under more scrutiny than most. Also, that bar is largely
  arbitrary.
* Cede power to PoC. When we vote, hire, and promote PoC we are helping
  distribute power that is typically concentrated amongst a select few.

#### Behaviors To Work On

* I may not be telling racist jokes or hurling racist slurs. I may not be
  the person following a black woman in a store or calling the cops on a black
  man bird-watching. Though I may not be conscious of my actions (or my
  inaction), there is a chance I am creating harm or perpetuating it. Be
  deliberate about my choices. This is why it's referred to as "doing the
  work": it takes effort.
* I will likely feel guilt (by association; because I did find that joke
  funny once). That is for me to reflect on. I may feel anger at being called
  or perceived as racist. That is an opportunity to stop, consider the
  circumstances, and seek to understand.
* Centering myself in the conversation about race. I am going to have
  feelings. Recognize that what I am beginning to feel is a small example of
  the effects of oppression and systemic racism that PoC navigate on a daily
  basis. Do not make the subject of racism about how I am feeling. Do not
  engage in performative acts like renouncing my white privilege. These things
  distract from what really matters. And, on a practical note, saying a few
  words one time does not wipe away centuries of inertia that secured your
  privileged place in society.

## Now What?

It's simple: pick a step, a direction, and get started. And don't stop. Because
black lives matter and they deserve to live as we do.
