Lots of articles have been written about generative AI, and this is one of them.

I started scribbling this short post as a bit of prediction, but I think instead
I'll offer it as a small hope: the increased use of generative AI will lead folks
to reevaluate what trust, scholarship, and expertise look like.

Before Google started providing AI-driven search results, I didn't fully trust the
top 3 entries it returned. Though they were generally good, I'd still check the
second and third pages for additional content, just in case. I don't immediately
accept output from a single search engine query and I'm certainly not going to
trust guidance from disembodied software acting as an
[agent providing potentially life-threatening suggestions about the edibility of
wildlife](https://www.404media.co/ai-chatbot-added-to-mushroom-foraging-facebook-group-immediately-gives-tips-for-cooking-dangerous-mushroom/).

Broadening the set of information I consider helps me locate both
corroborating and contrarian content I can use to build knowledge. To ask better
questions. To refine scope. To improve my research. **This is scholarship.**
An important point here is that _use_ of AI does not, itself, provide
[understanding](/posts/AI-is-not-understanding.html). Coupled with a bit of
rigor and critical thinking it can _support_ the development of understanding.

For a long time, I think people have implicitly trusted technology companies'
products and services, to the point of deference. My evidence here is anecdotal:
friends and colleagues that have told me they don't look at Google search
results "below the fold", for example. But the more folks experience the limits
of generative AI, the more they will seek additional sources of information.
Inevitably they will identify human experts.

It's here that a bit of hope (optimism?) sneaks in: we will increasingly seek
out more local sources we can trust (generative AI being the global foil) and
build strong communities whose foundations are supported by expertise.
