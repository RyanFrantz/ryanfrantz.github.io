Barely hidden from the rushing throng and somehow amongst green and greening
trees.

Sunlight dappling.

Gliding, like a cool raindrop on the backside of a leaf, she walks away, to
refresh.

He yells (as is his way), "Hey! This is paradise!"

She looks back at him, she remembers their conversations.

And with the fierce demurity of a person actually in control of themselves,
she pronounces, "I know."

And it was.
