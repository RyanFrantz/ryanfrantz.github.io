Legacy systems make new development possible. Much like the decomposition of
this year's generation of plants will support next year's growth, our
experiences with existing systems fuel greenfield projects we'll take on in the
future. What you know now is foundational to what you create later.

Crucially, operating these systems encourages us to consider how we deliver
[care](/posts/care-for-software.html) for them because like humans, our systems
may not always be healthy. An ailing legacy system teaches us how to identify
degraded performance and confirm restoration. This background is necessary for
designing tomorrow's robust (though likely still susceptible) systems.

Embrace your legacy systems and learn from them.

This post was inspired by a number of ideas, not the least of which is this
quote from Donella Meadows:

<blockquote>
[M]astery has less to do with pushing leverage points than it does with
strategically, profoundly, madly, letting go and dancing with the system.
