Complexity is a by-product of success.

Consider all the living things in a forest, from the trees, to the fungi, to the
insects, to the birds. There is an incredible diversity within each group and
together they form a complex ecosystem. Each and every species that thrives in
that environment is there _precisely_ because it is successful.

## Success

"Success" may mean something different given various contexts. Here, I'm
thinking of success as an example of a
[positive reinforcing feedback loop](/posts/systems-thinking-in-practice.html#7-reinforcing-feedback-loops) that is present in systems. That is, a set of outputs, or
outcomes, results in a virtuous cycle that propagates itself. The loop may be
dynamic, growing as the outputs generate larger stocks from which the loop
feeds. As a thought experiment, let's imagine a small e-commerce business and
what complexity means for it, as it becomes successful.

## Dog Booties

Rainy - tired of cleaning up dog tracks; boots; folks begin asking for warm
booties. fancy booties; healing booties

Let's say I live in a rainy part of the country and I've got a few dogs that
love their walks. I love these pups, but I can't stand cleaning up their muddy
paw prints several times a day. Being crafty, I spend a weekend creating some
basic booties 

## Additional Thoughts

Motivation for writing this post includes recurring conversations I hear about
what it means to manage complexity and the (typically) negative connotations of
doing so. I believe that what is often ballyhooed as "complexity" is actually
what might be better understood as "complicated". The latter term can often be
summarized as "unclear how this works" or "I have difficulty making sense of
this thing." What is complicated is a matter of perspective.

In a subtly different way, complexity is also a matter of perspective, albeit
about which we choose to focus. For example, when describing a complex system
such as a forest, we tend to do so at a macroscopic level, detailing the plants,
animals, and overall conditions in which they live. Certainly, though, there is
additional complexity at the cellular level, not only within each organism but
especially across them. What's to stop of from expanding that description to
that of the molecules and individual atoms that comprise those structures? Or
the physical and electromagnetic phenomena that move and shape day-to-day
conditions?

I do not think complexity is a thing to be feared or avoided, but understood as
the outcome of many processes over an extended period of time. It is a topic
to be explored in the hope that we might glean some useful knowledge about it
and the forces that shape it. And, if nothing else, to revel in the beauty of
it, which in, and of itself, is a worthy pursuit.
