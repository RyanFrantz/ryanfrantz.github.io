I'm a fan of [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). I primarily use it to write blog posts
(I use [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) to generate static HTML) and documentation for Github repos.

I'm also on a train a lot lately and I find that even with a a [MiFi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MiFi)
device, there are often times that my Internet connection is spotty. Knowing this, I have recently taken
the time to update documentation for an upcoming project I expect to open source.

Writing in Markdown is pretty simple, but sometimes I like to check my work (i.e. to find bugs like missed
closing code fences) before I commit the documentation to the repo. While there are plenty of online editors
that can help with this, if I've not opened one *before* I've lost connectivity, I typically have to wait until
I get closer to civilization. Also, I'm impatient, especially when I'm in the groove of writing.

Digging around, specifically for an editor that supports [Github flavored Markdown](http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/),
I came across a [handy markdown editor](https://github.com/jbt/markdown-editor) that one can run locally:

Thanks to [@jbt](https://github.com/jbt) I can satisfy my need for immediate feedback when writing documentation,
especially while on a train, in the sticks.
