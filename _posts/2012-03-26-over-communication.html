I stood in as chair of a recent committee meeting at work and had the misfortune of doubling as the secretary, tasked with noting and writing up the meeting's minutes.  For convenience, I recorded the meeting so that I could transcribe it later.  Worse than the tedium of the transcription was listening to myself!  I couldn't stand listening to my voice drone on.  I found that I often repeated myself, albeit in new and novel ways, in an attempt to either influence a discussion or hammer an idea home in the minds of my unfortunate peers.<br>
<br>
I shared this bit of introspection with my boss and a small grin grew on his face.  He simply replied, "I know.  You also say 'generally speaking' a lot."  Generally speaking, he was right.<br>
<br>
Since then I have vowed to make my points concisely.  And only once.  Over-communicating is just as bad as under-communicating; folks start to tune you out and your message is never heard.<br>
<br>
Generally speaking, that's a bad thing.
