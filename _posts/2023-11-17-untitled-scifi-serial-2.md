[Part 1](/posts/untitled-scifi-serial.html)

These Uplinkers know something. That's why I'm here. Some of these fuckers are
rich. Insanely rich. A few of them made boatloads in the 20s selling AI
solutions. This was back when folks hoped AI meant "artificial intelligence" but
in practice was simply predictive text. Customers caught on and didn't want
those services anymore. So many companies offered AI but most folks were locked
in to the first vendor they had tried; the costs to transfer data _out_ of one
solution to another was astronomical, on top of the cost and time to have all
that data run through different language models. So the dopes that ran these
companies just kept bilking their customers.

Still, these same dopes periodically promise real artificial intelligence is
"almost here." And it never arrives, despite them trotting out some benign
example of "AI" that solves a problem no one actually cares about. See, everyone
know there is something about intelligence we can't describe. We can't quantify
it and so we can't digitize it. Except today, and for the past several days,
supposedly we're finally seeing artificial intelligence. And it's in that
goddamned "thinking" 3D printer everyone is freaking out about.

Joaquin is exiting the elevator. Why is he walking like that? Tom Cruise can
write dramatic running into his movies; Sam Rockwell does his goofy dances.
Joaquin looks like a toddler triping over his feet, inches from disaster. And
he's got a shit-eating grin on his face.

That can only mean one thing: we're in!
