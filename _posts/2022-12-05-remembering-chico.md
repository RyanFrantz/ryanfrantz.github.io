# Chico

The ground yielded, this frozen morning

As soft and warm as his velvet ears

The sun shone, bright and without warning

That even heat could not thwart the tears

He was a spark, brief and light

A sharp bark, scared thieves at night

So deep his love has driven

And endless joy he'd given

Sweet boy, our hearts break for you

We're grateful your ache is through
