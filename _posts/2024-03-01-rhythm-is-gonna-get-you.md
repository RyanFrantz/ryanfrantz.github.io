It's Friday. The week is winding down. We order pizza and wings and fries. We
tune in to some trash TV and tune out from the world for a few hours. We do this
every week. It's our rhythm.

Except this week.

For the past 7 days, a few of us have been sick. Our rhythm is off. It's funny
how being out of step throws the entire cycle into relief. None of it seems
important; not the day, the pizza, or the TV. It's fun, of course, but I could
care less if we miss any of it today.
