Senior engineers don't grow on trees, so they say. That is, you can't simply
walk outside and pluck one from a low-hanging branch and reap the benefits of
all that experience.

Except, they do. That is, if you consider that trees take years, decades even,
to mature and you think of a tree as an organization that fosters an engineer's
growth over time.

Senior engineers come from _somewhere_, but not overnight.

Start investing time and energy into yours. Be patient. And reap the benefits of
all that experience.
