I just came across Tom Perrine's blog and the page <a href="http://thuktun.wordpress.com/toms-rules-for-happy-sysadmins-and-users/" title="Tom's Rules">Tom's Rules</a>.  Rule #29 really resonated with me since I implemented Request Tracker (RT) 6 months ago:<br>
<blockquote>If you don’t have a ticketing system, you’re doing it wrong.  If you have a bad ticketing system that you or your users hate, or makes it harder to get things done, you’re doing it wronger.</blockquote>
<br>
RT replaced a home-grown ticketing system that had me and my team doing more work to manage the system than fulfilling the requests that came into us.<br>
<br>
Give the rules a read; they're worth the time to help reflect on what we do every day as sysadmins.
