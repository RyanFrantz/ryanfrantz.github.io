Since posting about <a href="http://www.ryanfrantz.com/2011/10/26/request-tracker-hacking-reports-update/">custom Request Tracker reports</a>, I've written several more reporting scripts.  In general, many of them are variations on about 3-4 scripts, but they all serve a purpose: providing me with some metrics on the performance of my Support Desk.<br>
<br>
I've shared those scripts with the masses on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/RyanFrantz/Request-Tracker-Reports">Request-Tracker-Reports</a><br>
<br>
Enjoy!
