I've been reflecting a lot lately on the good and bad decisions I've made as a manager.  While doing some reading online, I came across <a href="http://tomayko.com/writings/management-style" title="http://tomayko.com/writings/management-style">this link</a> from Ryan Tomayko's site (thanks <a href="http://twitter.com/obfuscurity/" title="http://twitter.com/obfuscurity/">@obfuscurity</a>).  In the same vein, I thought it pertinent to share my experiences, with regard to the worst decision I've made (to date).<br>
<br>
I moved out.  I left the physical space where my team sits.  It was a dumb, selfish idea.  I thought that by moving into a space separate from my team, it would let me focus on "management" and them focus on "the work".  Dumb, dumb, dumb.  I didn't recognize the downside of such an arrangement and I didn't recognize the upside of being side-by-side with my team every day.<br>
<br>
So, how did I come to this realization?  We had a power outage.  One half of our campus had power and my team convened in a large conference room there.  We pumped music through the overhead speakers, streamed monitoring data via the projector, and had <strong>excellent</strong> communication due to the open layout of the room.  I asked my team if they liked the format (we were in there for 2 days) and every one of them, <strong>every</strong> one of them, agreed.<br>
<br>
As a result, two things are going to happen:<br>
<ol>
	<li>I and my team will hold all-day get-togethers in our largest conference room at least once a month.  Even in the face of a serious campus outage, my team worked extremely well together while sitting in an open space.  Many folks might think the layout isn't productive.  I found it to be just that.</li>
	<li>I am going to give up my current seating in favor of seating close to my team.  I noticed that the free and open exchange of ideas and my proximity to the team made for better communication, faster issue resolution, and general camaraderie.</li>
</ol>
<br>
It is only through personal circumspection and asking questions of my team that I get better as a manager.  I am grateful to have positive experiences (and a few negative ones) to learn from and improve my skills.  I'm also grateful to others for sharing their experiences like Ryan Tomayko (looking at you <a href="http://twitter.com/mrembetsy" title="http://twitter.com/mrembetsy">@mrembetsy</a>) so that I can study from them and better reflect on what I do every day.
