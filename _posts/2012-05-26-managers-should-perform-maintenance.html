IT managers should, from time to time, participate in routine maintenance events.  I just did and I learned a lot.  In brief, I made the following 3 observations:
<ol>
	<li>Maintenance events suck!</li>
<ul>
	<li>Even when well planned, with thoroughly defined steps and contingency plans, maintenance is tedious and stressful.</li>
</ul>
	<li>Checklists need to be reviewed and updated often.</li>
<ul>
	<li>Checklists are useful to ensuring consistent results.  But they break down when their content doesn't reflect the current state of your technology.  I made <strong>8</strong> discoveries about our checklist that require addressing and correcting.</li>
</ul>
	<li>You're only as good as your tools.</li>
<ul>
	<li>We use a number of tools before, during, and after maintenance events.  I found some glaring issues with some of them.  For example, some are needlessly complex and some don't quite do what we need/expect them to.</li>
</ul>
</ol>
<br>
So?  What to do?<br>
<br>
First, I'm going to make sure my team is well stocked with refreshments and snacks during maintenance events.  They need something to take the edge off.  Second, we're going to make it a post-maintenance task to update the checklist based on a postmortem analysis of the event.  Third, we're going to find better tools to replace what doesn't work.<br>
<br>
And finally, I'm going to take my team to lunch next week to thank them for their continued efforts.
