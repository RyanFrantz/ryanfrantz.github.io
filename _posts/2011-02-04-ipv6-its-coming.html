<a href="http://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</a> brought me to this <a href="http://www.securityweek.com/its-official-ipv4-out-time-transition-ipv6">article</a> on securityweek.com about the impending need to roll out IPv6 in the wake of the last few blocks of IPv4 addresses having been allocated to the various RIRs.  Looks like we've got our work cut out for us.  Time to fire up some IPv4-to-IPv6 tunneling solutions and get ready for <a href="http://isoc.org/wp/worldipv6day/">World IPv6 Day</a>.
