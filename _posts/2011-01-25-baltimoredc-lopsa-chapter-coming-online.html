A new <a title="LOPSA" href="https://lopsa.org/" target="_blank">LOPSA</a> (League of Professional System Administrators) chapter is coming online in the Baltimore/DC area.  I'm pleased to have the opportunity to participate in the building process.  The necessary resources are being drawn together and the first meeting is tentatively scheduled for March 2, 2011 and will be held in a soon-to-be announced location in Columbia, MD.<br>
