In my mind, things like comments in code and context in JIRA tickets (what we’ll
deliver; how we know it has been delivered) are more than
[administrivia](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/administrivia):
**they help orient a reader’s attention**.

When I think about this topic, I recall a quote from someone much smarter than
me:

> In an information-rich world, the wealth of information means a dearth of
something else: a scarcity of whatever it is that information consumes. What
information consumes is rather obvious: it consumes the attention of its
recipients. Hence a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention and a
need to allocate that attention efficiently among the overabundance of
information sources that might consume it.

Writing can potentially direct attention. Doing so is economical for everyone.
