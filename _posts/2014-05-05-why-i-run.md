I'm running again.  I say *again* because it's been some time since I've done so consistently.  It feels good.
Each run gets more enjoyable than the last and today I remembered why I like to run.

I run...
* to be happy
* to be healthy
* to be strong
* to remember to breathe
* to get outside in the sun, the rain, the hot, and the cold
* to work out problems (often without even knowing it)
* to set an example for my kids
* to keep *up* with my kids
* to be more creative
* to be ready for emergencies (think zombies)
* so that at my funeral, the heaviest thing my family has to deal with is their hearts
* because I can
