These are slides from a presentation I gave on the topic of engineering
ownership. I plan to write a long form version of this, but this
[@mcfunley-style](https://dotclub.club/) format will have to do for now.

Owners support coordination. We _need_ coordination.

Synonyms.

Framing for this discussion: we are an _interdependent_ group that _intends_ to
work toward a common goal.

System boundaries are arbitrary. We can redraw them. There is no distinction
between the work you do as an engineer and the product itself. Is Customer
Service distinct from the product? Nope.

This is a common point of view for many folks when they get started in their
career.

Look how messy and undefined it all is!

We communicate over time, media, audiences, etc. Duplication feels wasteful, but
it helps reach people where they are.

This is a non-exhaustive set; it's a short list of folks with which you will
coordinate.

Assess impact on delivery; identify your own ability to learn and fill gaps to
address dependencies.

Basic framework for how I think about planning. It's NOT a prescription for a
planning template. Share with others so they can factor into their own planning.

Planning, like software, is never done. Rinse and repeat for each iteration.

Keep those loops TIGHT! Sometimes it's OK to request feedback, not receive it,
and move on. There is an art, borne from experience, that helps you gauge when
this is OK.

ADRs. RFCs. Design docs. Share what makes sense at the time.

![](/images/eng_ownership/14.png)

Yeah, but it's not as big a part of being an owner as you might suspect.

Others gain confidence in you, in the work. Reinforces the interdependence of
the group.

Drive it home, y'know? If you have a single source of truth and use it as an
anchor when delivering your message, it can be a powerful combo.

Surprise! It's _work_.
