Once upon a time, I thought it would be important to register an enterprise number with IANA.  I had grandiose ideas of creating immense MIBs, namespaces, schema, etc. (i.e. for SNMP).  I was young and ideologic; I didn't have clue one about what content would go into those schema.  Still, I registered enterprise numbers because I knew I could.  In a brief fit of nostalgia, I looked them up at <a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/enterprise-numbers/" title="IANA Enterprise Numbers">http://www.iana.org/assignments/enterprise-numbers/</a>:<br>

If you too would like to register an enterprise number with IANA, you can do so here:<br>

I highly recommend, though, that you do so only if you plan to do something with it.  I never did and it serves as a reminder to me that planning is crucial to achieving my goals.  At least, in that context, those numbers serve some small purpose.
