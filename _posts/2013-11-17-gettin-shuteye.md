## I Need to Sleep
As I draft this, I'm tired.  I've been up late nights either reading, coding,
playing with a new tool or watching
[The Avengers](http://marvel.com/avengers_movie/) for the umpteenth time
(I **really** dig it).

Some nights I go to bed at a decent hour.  And I almost always stay up late the
following night working on some idea. You see, I love to learn and I don't ever
want to stop.  I'm always trying to improve myself; whether it's a new
language, my first capture-the-flag event, or learning to play the harmonica,
I try to squeeze as much as I can into the time that's available.  I set goals
and go after them.

However, there's a tradeoff being made here; a big one.  By staying up late,
I'm sacrificing a lot.  Interestingly, not getting sufficient sleep has a
cascading effect.  When I don't sleep enough, I am tired.  I might not be
able to focus as much at work (depending on how much of Avengers I chose to
watch).  Then, I get frustrated that I'm not making enough progress on a
project. That can lead to a general dissatisfaction that may carry over to 
dinner time where I'm short with the kids or don't pay attention to the fact
that my wife just hit another running PR, because I'm still thinking about
work.  So I stay up late to close the gap, and the cycle repeats.  Perhaps I
find solace in the old "there aren't enough hours in the day" adage.

That's not good enough for me.  You see, not only do I want to be a better
engineer, I want to be a better husband, father, and person.  I want to produce
and I want to he happy.  I have work-related and personal goals that I want to
accomplish.

## There Really Aren't Enough Hours in the Day, a Monologue

When constraints are applied to a system, in this case, our day, our output is
limited.  Fascinatingly, this can be liberating.  Imagine you've built a long
list of to-do items.  The longer the list, the greater the chance of choice
paradox setting in (which items to tackle first).  When time is limited, it
forces us to focus on the things that matter.  It's freeing to recognize that
given a small amount of time, some things won't get done.  **This is a good**
**thing!**  It means we can prioritize our work and get closer to achieving our
goals.  If it's not important, it doesn't go on the to-do list (wish lists are
OK but I'm leaving those out of this discussion).

Getting better at prioritizing starts (for me) with getting more sleep and 
understanding that I won't be able to do everything I want to do every single
day.  This was a difficult realization for me to make.  Or, my pride kept me
from acknowledging this for some time.  But my sense of pride also forced to
recognize that I've not been hitting some of my goals.  So something has to
change.


## Sleep Goal
I've thought a lot about managing my sleep, even talked about it a little but
I've not done much about it.  I've been wearing a
[Jawbone UP](https://jawbone.com/up) for a few months now to track my sleep and
activity, but I've not yet attempted to hit any sleep goals.  So now, I will.

I plan to get at least 8 hours of sleep each night.  Simple.

## Final Thoughts
We all need sleep to be productive and happy.  How one measures those two
qualities can vary.  My team at Etsy has been doing some really
[interesting things](http://codeascraft.com/2013/09/28/nagios-sleep-data-and-you/)
with our sleep data that we've been collecting.  We have more ideas in
the pipeline such as measuring the mean time to sleep (MTTS) when we're woken
up to address Nagios alerts and the on-call rotations' impact on one's
cognitive abilities.

I'll write more about these things as we learn more.

But first, I've got to catch some Z's.
